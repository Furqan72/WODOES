        <p>Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over? (Surat Baqara,
            Verse 245)</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It should be noted that Allah, who is in need of no one and nothing, instills upon his men to give
            Qarz-e-Hasana because it is in man's nature to be fugal whilst spending his wealth. Allah speaks about qarz
            because it is returned and Allag promises that He will return the goodly loan by 70 folds. Allah conveys his
            message to the Muslim ummah through the Holy Prophet Muhammad prompting Muslims to spend their wealth in a
            certain way. He says,Oh children of Adam! Trust me with your wealth. If you do so, no fire,flood or thieves
            will be able to rob you off your money. Instead you will be endowed with your wealth when you most need it.
            He further says that the poor and the weak will not remain hungry and naked expect due to the negligence of
            the rich, who should not be stingy in spending their money on those worse off than themseles. Allah will not
            only take strict accountability from those people but He will also punish them acordingly. On the Day of
            Judgment, the rich will be humiliated because they did not help the needy. The needy will complain to Allah
            and say that all those men on whom you graciously bestowed the rights of the wealths showed negiligence in
            its proper use; they were busy spending on themselves and forgot about us, the ones who needed it. Alaag
            will reply to this and say : "I swear on my respect and glory! I will bring you closer to me and push them
            further away."</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Allhamdollialah, Allah has accorded our organization with the highest favor by sending those people our way
            who follow the teachings of the Holy Quran and Hadith, give zakat, fidyah, fitrah, khairat and other
            donations to help us help those in need. The purpose of sending this message to you is so that you not only
            spread this message to others but also play your part in helping us to continue serving and helping the
            needy till the Day Judgment.</p>
